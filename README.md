# EduGrader

EduGrader is a platform designed to assist students who cannot afford tutors or mentors but are eager to learn and improve their knowledge. EduGrader provides an AI-powered system where students can answer questions, receive marks, and get detailed feedback on their mistakes and areas for improvement.

## Features

- **Personalized Learning**: Students receive questions based on their skill level and learning goals.
- **AI Assessment (Gemini)**: After answering questions, our AI system, Gemini, grades the answers, assigns marks, and provides insights on mistakes and improvements needed.
- **Class Level Evaluation**: EduGrader helps categorize students into different levels based on their performance and understanding.
- **Mistake Tracking**: Detailed feedback on common mistakes and advice on how to avoid them in the future.

## How It Works

1. **Answer Questions**: Students are given questions to answer based on their level.
2. **AI Grading**: The AI (Gemini) evaluates the answers and assigns marks.
